In this project, we implemented a robot-advisor which is an application optimizing a portfolio with given assets.
We implemented these features:
- The optimization of the portfolio composition (The assets of the portfolio).
- The optimization of the portfolio asset weights.
The portfolio is optimized with respect to the Sharpe ratio (see Section 1)
